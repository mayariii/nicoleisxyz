Welcome to my first *ever* blog post!

I’m Nicole, a creative, multi-passionate engineer. I’m an English-Filipina from the UK, and I’m starting a blog, highly inspired by several cool people I’ve come across fairly recently. 😎

Firstly, this blog will be personal, a little corner of the internet that I can add to and grow up with. I’m currently 24, entering the next phase of my career, and learning *a lot*. I’m certain that the next few years will be interesting to navigate.

Creating a personal blog was highly inspired by Pauline Narvas ([pawlean.com](https://pawlean.com/)), a Filipina trailblazer who calls herself a ‘nicheless’ blogger. Her [blogging story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fybQ2oId1I4) opened my eyes to added benefits writing on the internet:

1. Sharing who you are
2. Paying it forward
3. Connecting with others
4. Building up your skills
5. Having fun, and finding it therapeutic!

Secondly, it will be a place to ‘share my work’. I first came across the book ‘[Share Your Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work)‘ by Austin Kleon, from one of my favourite YouTubers Ali Abdaal, when he shared the [books that changed his life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1gOEY3cs4). It’s a short, insightful read on the benefits of learning in public and, well, sharing your work! A brilliant example of this is [Scott Hanselman’s blog](https://www.hanselman.com/) where he has been sharing his notes online for nearly 20 years! I discovered him through a retweet of [one of his talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HE5LJwAv1k).

> *“One little blog post is nothing on its own, but publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work.” - Austin Kleon*

I’m super excited to have a space to share my thoughts, notes, current and future learning. In the words of Austin Kleon, “**become a documentarian of what you do**“.
