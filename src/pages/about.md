I think my creative/tech journey started off in the days of Windows 98 when I was this small! I loved playing around with programs like MS Paint, Publisher, Word Art, and loved making my  school homework stand out. Throughout school and college my interest in digital work grew during GCSE Product Design and Digital Applications lessons, where I first learned about the design process, how to create a simple website using HTML, and entering the world of multimedia. I had a phase of being obsessed with creating Piczo websites, a.k.a home of the glittery graphics!

University gave me the opportunity to combine creativity with deeper technical knowledge, with a degree in Product Design Engineering. It was here I understood the importance of the user in design, design fundamentals and a first glimpse into software engineering. Alongside studying I dived right into volunteering Media and Marketing for various university organisations.

Since then, I've loooooved continous learning, and developed a huge interest in web development and coding. I have completed the #100DaysOfCode challenge, #365DaysOfCode and aiming for #1000DaysOfCode now!

I am intrigued by self-development topics and love to consume all the things about how we can be our best selves through self-improvement, mindset, learning and wellbeing.

I'm also really proud to have raised a lot of money for charities. I've jumped out of a plane, ran a marathon, abseiled off a cathedral, and bungee jumped off a crane. Terrifying, but they did give me some new life perspectives - like anything is possible if you have 20 seconds of courage! I raised over Â£2000 for Mind the mental health charity - a subject that means a lot to me and that I have been aiming to normalise conversations about.

My interests and goals have been ever-growing but in a nutshell, my aim is growing myself, growing others and growing the world. ðŸŒ±

Oh and cats. Love them.
